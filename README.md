AWS EC2 Wrapper for PHP
========================

This package wraps around Amazon's SDK for EC2 to provide a more object-orientated interface. 
Thus the developer will spend less time looking up the parameters they can pass into an array.
This version of the wrapper is based on [version 3 of the SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/api/class-Aws.Ec2.Ec2Client.html).
